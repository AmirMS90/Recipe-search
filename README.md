# Recipe Search

#### Video Demo: <URL HERE>

#### Description:

This is a web based flask project where you can search for food recipe using search with name and search with ingredient. It uses a free api named [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php). It has a simple and friendly UI. It has some simple animations too. It uses a color palette from [Coolers](https://www.coolers.co). It uses a limited number of colors but it has a cool and warm theme. The program sends a request to the api using pythons requests packageand gets the response back. Then it'll show the results as links and with a preview containging the image of the food and the name of it. With clicking on any food you will be transported to /meal end point where it'll get the foods id and using the api show all the details of it. The main page is only a welcom screen. Theres a footer below the page that shows or better to say links to some of my social media for contacting me. Theres an apology page too that will show up if you try to inter nothing in the search box or any other error. For every error it gets an error code and a message and it would show it in the simplest way exept for error code 404 it only gets error code and will show a funny meme I found online.
