# Recipe Search

This project is a web-based Flask application that allows users to search for food recipes using either the recipe name or ingredients. It utilizes the free API called TheMealDB to fetch the recipe information. The application has a simple and user-friendly interface, with some basic animations and a color palette inspired by the Coolers website.
